<h1>How to play Dominoes</h1>

<p>Dominoes is played with a set of tiles, also known as bones, labelled with two numbers. If playing with a set of Double-6 
dominoes, these numbers range from 0 - 6. Other less common sets include Double-9 and Double-12. This game lets you play
with any set between Double-4 (for a very short game) and Double-9 (for a long game).</p><br/>

<p>The goal is to win rounds by getting rid of all the bones in your hand, or if neither player can play, having 
the lowest weight hand. The weight of a hand is the sum of all the numbers on the bones in your hand. 
The winner of the round wins a number of points equal to the weight of the loser's hand.
The game is over after a specified number of points.</p><br/>

<p>Each player starts a round by taking 7 bones. The left over bones are known as the boneyard.
The game can start either by a random player drawing an eighth tile from the boneyard and playing it immediately,
or by the player with the highest doublet(a tile which has the same numbers on each half) playing first.</p><br/>

<p>For the remainder of the game the players take turns playing bones from their hand on
the table. A player can play a bone on the table by matching a number on their bone to a
bone on the ends of the layout (the bones already played). There are only two possible places
to play each turn, one on the left and one on the right of the layout. The
number on the other side of the domino (the one not matched) will become the new left or
right hand number of the layout. </p><br/>

<p>If a player cannot play, they must draw bones from the boneyard until they can play. If the
boneyard is empty, then the player must pass their turn. The round ends when a player
plays all of their bones, or when both players pass (in succession). The winner is the player with the lowest
weight hand, and collects points equal to the weight of the loser's hand. The game is over
when a player scores a predetermined number of points (the default is 100).</p>
